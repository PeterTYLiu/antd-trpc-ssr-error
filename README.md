# AntD + Next.js + tRPC + SSR = ðŸ˜ž

This is a [T3 Stack](https://create.t3.gg/) project bootstrapped with `create-t3-app`. It is a minimal reproduction of this bug. Seems to be related to this: https://github.com/mantinedev/mantine/issues/2880

## Usage

```
npm i
npm run dev
```

Output when visiting app:

```
TypeError: useInsertionEffect only works in Client Components.
Add the "use client" directive at the top of the file to use it.

```

This can be resolved by removing `ssr: true` in `src/utils/api.ts` (line 51), but we want SSR to work.
